# tower-defense
A Tower Defense game programmed in Java

I created this game along an amazing tutorial by Kaarin Gamings.
The code was built from scratch and I created my own sprite atlas for a unique look. 
Many hours were spent on finding bugs and much was learned! Enjoy!

TO DO: 
- improve path finding so there are no checks for move during runtime
- add win-screen
- design new sprite atlas

(note) I decided to leave comments at a minimum following a clean and understandable coding practice

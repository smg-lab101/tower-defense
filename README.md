A Tower Defense game programmed in Java

The author of this game is SMG and the code is based on Kaarin Gamings amazing tutorial for a Tower Defense Game.
This code was built from scratch and I created my own sprite atlas for a unique look.

Enjoy!

TO DO: 
- improve path finding so there are no checks for move during runtime
- add win-screen
- design new sprite atlas
